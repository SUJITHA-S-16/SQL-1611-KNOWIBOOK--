        "***2.Network Access***\n",
        "\n",
        "A software program in the RDBMS is designed specially to catch requests sent over a network, facilitating client-database communication. Users need not log in for accessing or using the database, affording them greater convenience.\n",
        "\n",
        "This feature also makes it possible for developers to build web apps and desktop tools that make database interaction possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "***3.Language***\n",
        "\n",
        "RDBMS supports SQL, a standard and familiar language; it has a simple syntax, and uses English phrases and keywords, making it easy to learn and understand. RDBMS also has the capability to insert non-SQL database-centric keywords, features, and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "***4.Performance***\n",
        "\n",
        "RDBMS is not intrinsically a fast-performing database, but with the database design, there are several optimizations embedded into it, which actually enhances performance. This eventually translates into fast performance for all data sets and apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "***5.Maintenance***\n",
        "\n",
        "It is easier to maintain RDBMS as the tech support team or database administrators can control, test, maintain, and perform backup for the databases they have within their main system. The functions are automated via inbuilt automation tools on the operating system in the RDBMS.\n",
        "\n",
        "***6.Multi-Person Access***\n",
        "\n",
        "We have already seen that multiple users can access the database at the same time. During data change or updating, users can leverage the inbuilt functionality of transaction management and locking for data access.\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the system is protected from crashing due to multiple users working on the data, and users are not allowed to partially modify data.\n",

        "***7.Prevents Data Redundancy***\n",
        "\n",
        "This is one of the most important RDBMS advantages. Data redundancy is prevented as tables with specific data have relations among themselves, and the necessary data is retrieved from prior tables.\n",

        "An RDBMS has features for privilege control and authorization, which means that the admin can reject database access requests as we saw earlier. Permissions are granted after verifying the specific database activities the users intend to carry out. The IP address of the remote client is also considered, and in combination with user authorization, it controls the access to selected systems."
